Hello, I'm Felipe, currently $idade years old, and I specialize in Backend Development with a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies related to performance optimization, volumetric data, and CLI solutions.

With a solid professional background as a Software Engineer, I've honed my skills in Content Delivery Networks (CDN), distributed systems, and security products. My expertise lies in crafting high-performance and scalable solutions capable of efficiently handling hundreds of millions of requests per day. I am proficient in Golang, Lua, Redis, MySQL, and Openresty, and I enjoy creating scripts using Shell Script.

I hold a technical course in Computer Network from SENAI Roberto Simonsen and am pursuing my undergraduate studies in Science and Technology at the Federal University of ABC. Additionally, I'm engaged in a Scientific Research project in the field of Applied Mathematics, focusing on the Optimization of Molecular Geometry.

I'm always open for a conversation, so if you're interested, please feel free to reach out :)

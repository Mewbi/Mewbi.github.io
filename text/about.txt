My name is Felipe Fernandes, I'm currently $idade years old, I'm a Backend Developer interested in technologies that involve performance, volumetrics data and CLI solutions.

I have professional experience as a Software Engineer in CDN (Content Delivery Network), distributed systems and security products. Working on performant and scalable solutions, capable of processing hundreds of millions of requests per day. I have experience using Golang, Lua, Redis, MySQL and Openresty.
